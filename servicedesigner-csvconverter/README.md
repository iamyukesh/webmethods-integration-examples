# Build a microservice converting csv flat file to xml or json using Service Designer 

This example shows you how to use service designer to

* create services for transforing an arbitrary CSV file to xml or json
* expose the services as Rest API.
* build a docker image hosting those services

webMethods Service Designer is a lightweight integrated design and development tool that includes:

* webMethods Service Development for designing and developing services for the webMethods Microservices Runtime and managing them under version control.
* Unit Test Framework for creating unit tests for the services that you develop and include in Continuous Integration for build verification.
* webMethods Microservices Runtime (referred to as Local Development Server) for deploying and testing the assets.

A more extensive description, especially a tutorial how to build the code yourself can be found in the Techcommunity [article](http://techcommunity.softwareag.com/pwiki/-/wiki/Main/Build%20a%20microservice%20converting%20csv%20flat%20file%20to%20xml%20or%20json%20using%20Service%20Designer).

Disclaimer: Service Designer is intended for rapid prototyping, you need an appropriate license if using generated assets in production environments.

## Requirements

* Windows 10 or Windows 2019 Server
* Docker for Windows with Engine 19.03 or newer  

## Preparation

### Get ServiceDesigner

Download ServiceDesigner.
Unpack it to a local directory (I'm assuming C:\Programs\wMServiceDesigner in the course of this howto).

http://techcommunity.softwareag.com/ecosystem/communities/public/webmethods/contents/downloads/webmethods-service-designer/index.html

## Build (or import) the package

* Start Service Designer by clicking ServiceDesigner.exe.
* When asked if you want to start the Local Development Server click yes. Otherwise click the menu item Server-Start in Designer.
* Wait until the server is started. You can either check if the admin page is reachable (http://localhost:5555/) or looking for

```shell
ISSERVER|| 2019-11-14 14:03:47 CET [ISS.0014.0002I] Initialization completed in 51 seconds. 
ISSERVER|| 2019-11-14 14:03:47 CET [ISS.0025.0016I] Config File Directory Saved 
```

in the console window.

The sample code is explained in this article in techcommunity:

Import the sample code 

If you want to get the package properly into your workspace using the git integration of designer, please have a look at [my article about getting packages from git or github into Service Designer](http://techcommunity.softwareag.com/pwiki/-/wiki/Main/Get%20a%20webmethods%20package%20from%20github%20into%20your%20service%20designer).

If you want to have it quick and easy, 
* Copy the directory Demo_CSV_Converter (located inside ISPackages ) inside C:\Programs\wMServiceDesigner\IntegrationServer\packages (This is just for demo purposes and not a recommended way to deploy packages to a Microservice Runtime or Inetgration Server).
* Go to it's admin page (http://localhost:5555/)
* On the left side expande the Packages section, click Packages-Management
* Click Activate Inactive Packages
* Select Demo_CSV_Converter.
* Click Activate Packages


## Build the Dockerimage

### Preparations

Switch windows docker desktop to windows containers.

Open a command prompt. You may need to start cmd as administrator to have all needed write permissions.

Login to docker to be able to pull the windows base image.

```shell
docker login -u youruser -p ****
```

Switch into the docker directory of your installation. If you placed the Service Deisgner into C:\Programs\wMServiceDesigner, it will be:

```shell
cd C:\Programs\wMServiceDesigner\IntegrationServer\docker
```

### Process of building images

Building an image consits of 2 phases with 2 steps each. The phases are

* Build a Microservice reference image. This contains the Microservice Runtime and in a real life environment would be used as base for multiple different service images. This image will not be startable.
* Build the service image. THis will use the base image and add your specific logic to it.

The steps in each phase are

* Create a dockerfile
* Build the image

### Build & run the example

Create the dockerfile for the base image for Microservice Runtime. The following command will create a dockerfile islean in the directory C:\Programs\wMServiceDesigner

```shell
is_container.bat createLeanDockerfile -Dfile.name=islean â€“Dimage.name=mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019
```

Build the base image

```shell
is_container.bat build -Dfile.name=islean -Dimage.name=islean:1.0
```

Create the dockerfile for the service image. The following command will create a dockerfile CSVConverter in the directory C:\Programs\wMServiceDesigner\IntegrationServer\packages

```shell
is_container.bat createPackageDockerfile -Dimage.name=islean:1.0 -Dfile.name=CSVConverter -Dpackage.list=Demo_CSV_Converter
```

Build the service image.

```shell
is_container.bat buildPackage -Dfile.name=CSVConverter -Dimage.name=csvconverter:1.0
```

Run the service image

```shell
docker run --name csvconverter -d -p 15555:5555 -p 19999:9999 csvconverter:1.0
```

#### Test it using html

If the container is running, issue one of the following lines in a webbrowser

http://localhost:15555/invoke/DemoCSVConverter.Services:CSV2Json?inCSV=a,b,c;1,2,3;10,20,30&lineDelimiter=;&fieldDelimiter=,

http://localhost:15555/invoke/DemoCSVConverter.Services:CSV2XML?inCSV=a,b,c;1,2,3;10,20,30&lineDelimiter=;&fieldDelimiter=,

where we assume

* the file is a,b,c;1,2,3;10,20,30
* the lines are delimited by ; 
* and the fields by ,

this is kept simple so it fits into the adress line of the browser, when calling with other clients you may pass real files.

#### Test it via Rest

You get the swagger for the Rest API via the following links

* Json http://localhost:15555/rad/DemoCSVConverter.Rest:CSV2JsonConverter_API?swagger.json
* Yaml: http://localhost:15555/rad/DemoCSVConverter.Rest:CSV2JsonConverter_API?swagger.yaml

Just import them into your Rest client of choice and call it with the parameters like

* inCSV: a,b,c;1,2,3;10,20,30
* lineDelimiter: ; 
* fieldDelimiter ,

### Diagnosis

If you want to introspect the running container, you may do so by issuing

```shell
docker exec -ti csvconverter cmd
```
